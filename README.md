# ProblemMediaTypeIssue

Basic project to demonstrate that using the `Produces` attribute to a controller stops it from returning a problem response with `media type` `application/problem+json` as it should.

You can easily use Swagger UI to see the returned header `media type` is `application/json` on problem2.

This project is adapted from https://github.com/ralphhendriks/aspnet-core-problem-details-media-type-issue
